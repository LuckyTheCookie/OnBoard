# LuckyTheCookieCard

## Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
This is the first time I've designed a pcb template, so I tried to make a business card using the tutorial. This card contains a qrcode, my name and an nfc chip.

##  How much is it going to cost?
It costs about $32 :)
I don't know if I get a $100 gift card or just the cost of the project, but I'll probably try to do another project if I have any money left in the gift card.

## Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? (Optionnal)
For a first-timer, I'm quite happy to have succeeded in this project. Even though I partly followed a tutorial, I had to manage importing images, fonts, text,... 
I had a few problems with the route tracing and it took me a while to correct this problem ^^
